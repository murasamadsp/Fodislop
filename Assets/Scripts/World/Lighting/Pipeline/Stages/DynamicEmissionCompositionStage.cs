/// Separate from the terrain's emission on purpose. Light transport is
/// linear in emission and the medium is the same either way, so the two
/// can be solved apart and summed at the end for exactly the result a
/// combined solve would give. That is what lets the terrain half be
/// cached until geometry changes while only this half is re-solved as
/// lamps move.
///
/// It also keeps the lights out of the ray march itself. They used to be
/// evaluated inside SampleEmission, which the march calls once per ray
/// step - one lamp cost as many iterations as the solve had steps, around
/// 238 million on the measured configuration, and a second lamp doubled
/// it. Here each source costs one small quad.
