/// <remarks>
/// This used to be four ints on <see cref="TerrainRenderer"/> holding one
/// min/max rectangle. That is correct for a player mining a single cell and
/// badly wrong for streamed chunks: they arrive scattered across the
/// viewport, each one small, and unioning two of them at opposite corners
/// produces a rectangle covering the whole screen. The renderer's size
/// check then measured that union, concluded the patch was not worth it,
/// and handed the frame to the full rebuild - which is how the debug
/// overlay came to read 9 rebuilds and 9 full repopulations. Every single
/// one.
///
/// Keeping the rectangles apart makes <see cref="TotalArea"/> describe the
/// cells a patch will actually visit, which is what that decision needs.
///
/// It is a separate type from the renderer because the interesting part is
/// arithmetic - clamping, unioning, overflow - and a MonoBehaviour cannot
/// be exercised without a scene. Here it can be fuzzed directly.
